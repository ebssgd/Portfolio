Utilizing React, I focused on a subject matter I was already familiar with to ensure my time was spent on the actual coding. Every aspect of the MERN stack was utilized in this site's creation, MongoDB is where the data is stored, Express sets up the back end, Reach is the font end, and Node pulls it together.",
